    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add wings and boil for 5 to 8
        minutes. Drain in a colander, run under warm water, then return to the
        dry pot. Add vinegar, water, bay leaves, peppercorns, onion, and
        jalapeños. Bring to a simmer, then simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add soy sauce and simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
        sauce has reduced by half. Transfer wings to a colander and set aside.
        Add whole garlic cloves to the liquid in the pan; simmer until the sauce
        has a syrupy consistency and the jalapeños have burst open, releasing
        all of their seeds into the reduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken wings and
        minced garlic. Cook and stir until garlic is tender and wings have
        browned, about 10 minutes. Return wings to the sauce to coat before
        serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken wings to bowl with reduced marinade and toss to coat.
        Transfer to a platter and garnish with reserved scallions, cilantro, and
        serrano. Sprinkle evenly with fried garlic. Serve immediately alongside
        Filipino pico and white rice.
